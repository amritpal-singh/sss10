        	          <h4>Introduction and Disclaimer</h4>
          <p>Steel Seismic Systems 10 (SSS10) has been developed as part of a continuing effort by the CISC to streamline the design of steel structures.  This mobile application is based off of the existing SSS10 Excel spreadsheet.  The purpose of this application is not only to enhance convenience, but to help users identify permissible structural steel seismic-force-resisting systems (SFRS) in accordance with NBC 2010 and CSA S16-09 for the Location, Importance Category, Site Class, and Building height provided in the user input.</p>
